Things To Do:
=============

1. Resync with git.ti.com/opencl.

   Update to latest common code from the TI repo.

2. Merge TI OpenCL DSP Device support from git.ti.com/opencl.

   Get the CPU and DSP device support to act as plugins to a common
   framework, so that they may coexist.

3. Builtins:

   The current clc.h has its roots in LLVM libclc, but has diverged.  It
   may be interesting to resync with that project, if those builtins
   actually pass the Khronos tests.

4. Update to OpenCL v 2.0

   An HSA compliant platform would benefit this effort.

5. Move to SPIR, or SPIR-V.

   Once a SPIR to ARM backend becomes available, could move to SPIR as a more
   standard IR.
