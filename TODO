Things To Do:


Features:
=========

1. Merge latest TI OpenCL DSP Device support

2. Update to OpenCL v 1.2

Issues:
=======

1. Khronos basic tests failures (both on ARM and x86_64), documented here:

tests/basic_test_failures.lst

2. Testing Full DSP Device support.

Requires extra TI DSP compiler, DSP side files and builtin library which are not 
currently released.

The build therefore defaults to SHAMROCK build type, for CPU Device only, and uses a CPU only
builtins library.  The clc.h, therefore, has not been tested with DSP Device builds.

3. Sanity Test, one kernel test failure 

See README.txt for latest results.
