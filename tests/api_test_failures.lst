=============
Failure Mode:   
------------
ERROR: Unable to build binary program! (CL_INVALID_OPERATION from /home/gpitney/opencl_1_2_conformance/test_conformance/api/test_binary.cpp:113)


Analysis:
---------
This is expected.  It is my claim that this test is violating the spec, by
attempting to build a proram with kernels already attached to the program.

See this comment in src/core/program.cpp:
// Per the v1.2 spec for clBuildProgram() and clCompileProgram():
// "Returns: CL_INVALID_OPERATION if there are kernel objects attached to program."
// Note this causes some Khronos tests to fail, like 
// test_compiler options_build_macro options_build_macro_existence options_include_directory, and
// test_api binary_create, as they all violate the spec in this regard.
    if (getNumKernels() > 0) {
	p_state = Failed;
        return(CL_INVALID_OPERATION);
    }
