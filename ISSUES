Issues:
=======


1. Khronos tests:

  The majority of basic v1.2 Khronos tests pass, proving that MCJIT is working
  pretty well for ARM.

  The following results were obtained with Shamrock on a Chromebook 2
  running Ubuntu 13.10 (ARMv7, 4 active cores).

  computeinfo:  1/1   PASS
  api:		71/72 PASS
  basic:	86/95 PASS
  buffers:	90/93 PASS
  commonfns:	17/17 PASS

  The Khronos test failures were diagnosed and documented here:

  tests/basic_test_failures.lst
  tests/api_test_failures.lst
  tests/buffer_test_failures.lst

2. piglit tests:

   The piglit tests were run on a HiKey board (ARMv8).

   1530/1543 tests passed.

   The failures included 8 API tests, and 5 for the builtin vector-conversion
   test (which passes on ARMv7).


3. DSP Device support:

  This requires extra TI DSP compiler, DSP side files and builtin library
  support which is released by TI as part of its Keystone II MCSDK-HPC product.

  Though the CMake files allow building for TI devices, all the DSP side files
  may not yet be at git.ti.com/opencl, so the build defaults to 
  SHAMROCK build type, building for CPU Device (ARM) only.
